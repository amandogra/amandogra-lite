There is a story about the time when `Ayodhya` was at peace. Everyone was happy and satisfied by the ways of their king Prabhu Ram.

All the demi-Gods knew that it was time for the King Ram to leave his body and go back to his heavenly abode. Even Ram knew it.

However, every time Yamraj, the God of death, would come to take Ram _ji_ with himself, Hanuman would stand guard and fend him (Yamraj) away.

To help Yamraj, Prabhu Ram threw him ring in a crack on ground and asked Hanuman to find it. It was a trick, but Hanuman, being Hanuman, reduced his size to that of a housefly and jumped through the crack.

He kept going down until he reached _patal lok_ (the depths of the netherworld).

There he was greeted by the king of snakes. He asked Hanuman, "What are you looking for?".

Hanuman replied, "I am Hanuman and I am looking for Ram’s ring".

King of Snakes said, "Come with me! I will give you the ring".

He took Hanuman to a room full of Ram’s rings. And asked him to take anyone. Hanuman was surprised and asked him that how could there be so many rings?

He replied, "Each ring represents one _kal chakra_ (The wheel of Time). In every _chakra_, there is a _treta-yug_ in which there is a Ram and a Hanuman.

Every time Ram will drop his ring and a monkey will come to _patal lok_ searching for his ring. By the time the monkey returns back to earth, Ram is gone".

Hanuman then understood the _kal-chakr_ and he let go of his dear God.
