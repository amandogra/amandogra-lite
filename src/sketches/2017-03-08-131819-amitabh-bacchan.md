People ask me, "Do you still draw?". Yes! I do, daily. I draw anything, everything around me on any kind of paper with any kind of pencil or pen available at the time.

However this time, I bought a new hardcover sketchbook and some new 'B' pencils and charcoal sticks. I created my first [tortillon](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiWvabd_MTSAhXkx1QKHWOvBcoQFggcMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTortillon&usg=AFQjCNEYPIyCCzb_3HWJYYZgQBfa4GxqTA&sig2=Q_0dX2bPixMQizwAB0l0Wg&bvm=bv.148747831,d.cGc). I followed many YouTube videos to find different techniques of drawing. I put in some dedicated time regularly to work on it phase by phase. I reckon that it is the only way to hone a skill.

This sketch is not perfect, nor my masterpiece, but I loved every moment doing it and want to do more like this. After a long time, I've done a portrait sketch and here it is the great living legend of bollywood, Amitabh Bachchan.
