The idea for this three panel comic strip was dropped by my 7 years old daughter.

Panel One:
![Kid watching his tablet while sitting on a sofa in a waiting room](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfrqtt95/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1610396230/108420821_3086101574949437_3729276796745193004_n.jpg_d8jc14.jpg)

Panel Two:
![Kid looks to his right surprisingly](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfrqtt95/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1610396252/110340447_156916596010946_4358198747730463401_n.jpg_rwttgq.jpg)

Panel Three:
![A big man sits on the right side of the sofa and the kid flies upwards](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlfrqtt95/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1610396273/110051568_575826606449123_5066418391364915944_n.jpg_ylzslo.jpg)

I still don't find this comic funny, however my kid laughs every time she looks at it.

Worth it! :)
