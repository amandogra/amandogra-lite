My kid still has to learn that 'people' is plural or 'person' and that 'person' is a word in English. This ignorance of her makes her funny and cute.

Recently it occured to me that I should add the transcript of the cartoon strip in case the font is not clear. Also it would help people with 'special' abilities.

### Transcript

**Chun:** Only one people[sic] is singing on the stage
**Mun:** But so many peoples[sic] are dancing on the floor
