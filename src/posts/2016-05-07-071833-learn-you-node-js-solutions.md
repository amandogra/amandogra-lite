Today I have completed [Learn You Node](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) exercises. You could find my solutions at this [GitHub](https://github.com/amandogra/learnyounodesolutions) link.

They are not same as those provided in the leanyounode help but they are similar and reflect only my knowledge of JavaScript.

You might be wondering where is Challenge1. Well it's 'Hello World'. You can do that yourself. :) Happy coding!
