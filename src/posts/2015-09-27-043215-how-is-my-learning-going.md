After sixteen days, I would like to record my progress about the learning list which I mentioned in my last post.

## Schoolism

I have completed the first chapter. I think it had 8 parts. There was an exercise too in which you have to sketch 5 faces including one that of Kim Jong-un. Out of 5, I have done only one, that also not complete.

## LearnPythonTheHardWay

I was at Exercise 13 of [Learn Python the hard way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/), when I read the comparison between Python and nodejs. I figured that NodeJS is comparable to Python. I already know Javascript and a little bit of (enough) NodeJs. So, I spent some time on learning node using the [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) tutorial.
But I have resolved to keep learning python "the hard way".

## CodeWars

I have not made any progress here.

## ViM

This is going good. Although ViM is not my IDE (It is still WebStorm), but it has become my favorite editor. I am writing even this post on ViM.

## TypingSpeed

Not taken any test in the last 15 days, so I am not sure I have improved my typing speed.

## Jekyll

Well, this is my third post on this blog and I have even learnt to include pictures. So I am learning Jekyll. I have to write a post on how I got started on Jekyll.
I also tried to add github projects to Jekyll, but was unsuccessful. I'll try it again.

## StackFlow & GitHub

No progress here.
