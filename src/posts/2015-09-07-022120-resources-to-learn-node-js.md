In this post I am going to share few resources which I find as helpful
for learning NodeJS. <!--more-->

Recently I have stumbled on a very good website to learn nodeJS interactively. [http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers)


![NodeJS Tutorial](/images/2015-09-07-022120.png)

I reached this tutorial from a book by Azat Mardan named "[JavaScript and Node FUNdamentals](https://leanpub.com/jsfun)"  Also, there is this great guy named Amit Rajan who explains nodeJS with examples at [http://amirrajan.net/nodejs-by-example/](http://amirrajan.net/nodejs-by-example/). In his own words,

> I prefer not to write blog post showing coding samples. They tend to
  go stale and lose relevance quickly. Instead, I publish sample apps to
  GitHub with pretty damn good documentation.

Subscribe to weekly newsletter on NodeJS at [http://nodeweekly.com/](http://nodeweekly.com/). This is quite helpful.

So, enjoy these while I find more relevant resources related to nodeJS.
